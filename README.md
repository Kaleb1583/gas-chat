this is a public chat i made with google apps script

Note: i used google sheets as the database which may not be that secure and if you plan on downloading and making your own private in a way chat youll have to make sheets and update the ids in the code.gs file

What i was doing on 7.20.24 (and after prob):
    1. reviewing code
    2. finding errors and fixing them
    3. making sure its functional (goes with 2.)
    4. updating code.gs so theres constants (<- like a variable that hold the id and names it) that equal sheet ids so you only have to edit constants instead of every getSpreadsheetById({ssid}) it will be getSpreedsheetById(SS Id constant)


10.1.24:
    i dont know if i fixed all the errors thats able to be noticed and i also dont know if all the spreadsheet (db's) are all set to the vars at the start of the .gs script
    im gonna upload the full thing since i just came back to this repo after forgetting it exsisted so i havent checked for any error but i dont wanna gatekeep it so here it is!.
