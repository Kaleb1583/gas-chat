this is a public chat i made with google apps script


add html file, name it "index", paste html
add gs file, name it "code", paste gs

(index.js is fetched in the html file and if you want to customize it fork this repo then replace my kaleb1583/gas-chat/index.js with yours YOURUSERNAME/gas-chat/index.js)


Note: i used google sheets as the database which may not be that secure and if you plan on downloading and making your own private in a way chat youll have to make sheets and update the ids in the code.gs file

What i was doing on 7.20.24 (and after prob):
    1. reviewing code
    2. finding errors and fixing them
    3. making sure its functional (goes with 2.)
    4. updating code.gs so theres constants (<- like a variable that hold the id and names it) that equal sheet ids so you only have to edit constants instead of every getSpreadsheetById({ssid}) it will be getSpreedsheetById(SS Id constant)


10.1.24:
    i dont know if i fixed all the errors thats able to be noticed and i also dont know if all the spreadsheet (db's) are all set to the vars at the start of the .gs script
    im gonna upload the full thing since i just came back to this repo after forgetting it exsisted so i havent checked for any error but i dont wanna gatekeep it so here it is!.
