this is a public chat i made with google apps script

i had only the js file here for use as an external js file 
im typing this on 7.20.24 im planning to post the .gs (google script apps) file with more than 1000 lines to complete it but i want to make sure everything is functional and able to be downloaded and used by anyone

Note: i used google sheets as the database which may not be that secure and if you plan on downloading and making your own private in a way chat youll have to make sheets and update the ids in the code.gs file
